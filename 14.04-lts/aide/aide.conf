# Logs are special: they are continously written to, may be compressed
# have their file name changed in different, mutually incompatibly ways
# and apprear and vanish at will. Handling this is a a complex and error-
# prone issue.
#
# This is best broken down in a number of small tasks:
#
#
# (A)
# While a live log is being written to, it doesn't change its mode and
# inode and its size only increases.
#
# (B)
# When a live log is rotated for the first time, it should not change
# its mode, may change its inode, and its size decreases. The size
# decrease may not be noticed by aide if the file had size x at the last
# aide run, was rotated in the mean time and was written to so that it
# had a size > x at the next aide run.
#
# (C)
# When a log is compressed, this looks to aide like the uncompressed
# file vanished (or was replaced by another file) and the compressed
# file appeared out of the blue. There is (currently) no way to
# associate the (gone) uncompressed file's contents with the (new)
# compressed file's contents
#
# (D)
# The actual log rotation may rename foo.{x}.bar to foo.{x+1}.bar without
# changing the other properties of the file
#
# (E)
# If only a given number of log generations is to be kept, foo.{y}.bar may
# vanish, but usually only when no foo.{z}.bar exists for z>y.
#
# (F)
# The set of files foo.{x}.bar to foo.{y}.bar is called a "log series"
# in aide terms, with the lowest x being called the "LoSerMember" element
# and the highest y being called the "HiSerMember" element, and the z
# with x<z<y simple called "SerMember". The Lo and Hi members need to
# be special cased in aide configuration.
#
#
# This is an example of the normal life of a log named foo in a logrotate
# configuration using a configuration at it is commonly used in Debian
# (from old to new):
#     1 logrotate deletes HiSerMember foo.{y}.gz
#     2 logrotate rotates SerMember foo.{z-1}.gz to foo.{z}.gz for all
#       z with 3<z<=y. This includes rotation of foo.{y-1}.gz to
#       foo.{y}.gz and foo.2.gz to foo.3.gz
#     3 logrotate compresses foo.1 to foo.2.gz, creating LoSerMember foo.2.gz
#     4 logrotate rotates foo to foo.1 (a simple rename)
#     5 logrotate creates new, empty foo
#     6 foo daemon logs to foo - foo grows in size
#
# we need the following rules:
# /var/log/foo$ Log
# /var/log/foo$ FreqRotLog
#    this takes care of the growing live log (step 7). The "Log" rule
#    is appropriate for logs that are not rotated daily as rotation
#    might be reported (if the file size has decreased since the last
#    aide run). For daily rotated logs, the "FreqRotLog" may be more
#    appropriate.
# /var/log/foo\.1$ LowLog
#    this takes care of step 5.
# /var/log/foo\.2\.gz$ LoSerMemberLog
#    this allows yet unknown new files to appear with a \.2\.gz extension,
#    covering step 3.
# /var/log/foo\.[3..y-1]\.gz$ SerMemberLog
#    this watches the log files as they wander through the Series,
#    changing only their file name but not their contents or metadata,
#    covering step 2.
#    Please note that [3..y-1] needs to be a manually crafted regexp covering
#    all numbers between 3 and y-1.
# /var/log/foo\.y\.gz$ HiSerMemberLog
#    finally, the last element of the Series is allowed to vanish without
#    being reported, covering step 1.
#
# Please note that these example rules need to be adapted to the logrotate
# configuration for the log. Compression may be disabled or lead to a different
# extension, the dateext option may be used, old logs might be held in a
# different place, a log series does not necessarily need to be compressed etc.
#
# Please note that savelog rotates the live log to .0 and not to .1 as it
# is logrotates (changeable) default.

# this should only be used for logs that are not rotated daily.
